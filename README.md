# WLang - The programming language for the web
## Why?
In February 2023 to January 2024 I was learning web development, from basics to advanced topics. To be honest, almost everything was kind of "easy" to learn and practice.

But I knew several people trying to learn web development but it's too difficult, and I can understand them because the web languages are divided into several sintaxis.

For example, here is a list of web languages with different sintaxis or concepts:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- PHP
- TypeScript (slight)
- Angular
- React.js
- Next.js

You get it, if you want to become a web developer you have to learn at least 3 or 4 different sintaxis.

But here is WLang (as a prototype for the moment). THE language that will centralize all those sintaxis in only one to simplify the web development but with the same features.
## Installation guide
1. Download the installer from [here](https://github.com/Zen-kun04/WLang/releases/tag/Prototype)
2. Open the installer. This will installer the compiler

## Code example
File: index.wl
```wl
main() {
    h1("This is a level-1 heading tag");
    p("This is a paragraph");

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

</head>

<!-- Made with <3 using WLang -->
```

## Complete example

```wl
head() {
    page.setLang("fr");
    page.setTitle("WLang Website");
}

main() {
    heading1("WLang");
    paragraph("The programming language for the web");
}

footer() {
    url("https://github.com/Zen-kun04/WLang", "GitHub");
}
```
